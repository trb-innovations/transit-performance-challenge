## Competition Objectives
The contest aims to advance the use of data by transit agencies to inform decisions. Using provided data as part of the contest and/or an agency’s own data, participants are encouraged to develop innovative approaches to analyzing data and communicating results. The contest is also designed to provide a professional development opportunity for young transit agency employees and encourage their participation in TRB.

## Data Description
Contestants have a variety of options to select from regarding data. Contestants working within a transit agency may select to utilize data from within the transit agency that he/she works. Alternatively, contestants are welcome to utilize data already provided publically through GTFS feeds (link below) or data provided for use in this contest by the following agencies:

   - [Metro Transit](Metro%20Transit%20Bus%20Incidents) (Minneapolis)
   - King County (Washington)
   - Denver RTD (Colorado)
